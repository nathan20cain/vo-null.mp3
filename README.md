    <b>Issues with missing vo\null.mp3</b><br />
</p>

Small fix for `*** Invalid sample rate (0) for sound 'vo\null.mp3'` in the current release of 64-bit Team Fortress 2. 

### Instructions
1.  Download the given null.mp3 file. This file is a 1-second long .mp3 of silence (44100hz sample rate), created in Audacity.
2.  Navigate to the TF2 files and find the `tf\custom` folder. 
3.  In this folder, create new custom folders or add to a preexisting custom folder to create the following path: `tf\custom\My_Custom_Stuff\sound\vo`
4.  In the vo folder, place the null.mp3 file.
